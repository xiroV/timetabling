# Modeling Timetabling Problems in Constraint Programming

This is most of the work I did related to my Master's Thesis back in 2019.

The thesis report can be found [Here](https://github.com/xiroV/timetabling/blob/main/docs/cp-timetabling.pdf).

A related project I did, [Solving the IMADA Timetabling Problem using Constraint-Based Local Search](https://github.com/xiroV/timetabling/blob/main/docs/imada-ls.pdf), is included as well, with sources related to modeling the problem using MiniZinc located in `imada-mzn`.
